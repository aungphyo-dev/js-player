###### 102. What's the value of output?

```javascript
const myPromise = () => Promise.resolve('I have resolved!');

function firstFunction() {
  myPromise().then((res) => console.log(res));
  console.log('second');
}

async function secondFunction() {
  console.log(await myPromise());
  console.log('second');
}

firstFunction();
secondFunction();
```

- A: `I have resolved!`, `second` and `I have resolved!`, `second`
- B: `second`, `I have resolved!` and `second`, `I have resolved!`
- C: `I have resolved!`, `second` and `second`, `I have resolved!`
- D: `second`, `I have resolved!` and `I have resolved!`, `second`

#### Answer: D

With a promise, we basically say _I want to execute this function, but I'll put it aside for now while it's running since this might take a while. Only when a certain value is resolved (or rejected), and when the call stack is empty, I want to use this value._

We can get this value with both `.then` and the `await` keyword in an `async` function. Although we can get a promise's value with both `.then` and `await`, they work a bit differently.

In the `firstFunction`, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is `console.log('second')` in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string `I have resolved`, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty.

With the await keyword in `secondFunction`, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

This means that it waited for the `myPromise` to resolve with the value `I have resolved`, and only once that happened, we moved to the next line: `second` got logged.
