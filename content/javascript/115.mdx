#### Answer: B

When adding a key/value pair using the `set` method, the key will be the value of the first argument passed to the `set` function, and the value will be the second argument passed to the `set` function. The key is the _function_ `() => 'greeting'` in this case, and the value `'Hello world'`. `myMap` is now `{ () => 'greeting' => 'Hello world!' }`.

1 is wrong, since the key is not `'greeting'` but `() => 'greeting'`.
3 is wrong, since we're creating a new function by passing it as a parameter to the `get` method. Object interact by _reference_. Functions are objects, which is why two functions are never strictly equal, even if they are identical: they have a reference to a different spot in memory.
