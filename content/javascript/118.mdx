};

const changeAge = (x = { ...person }) => (x.age += 1);
const changeAgeAndName = (x = { ...person }) => {
  x.age += 1;
  x.name = 'Sarah';
};

changeAge(person);
changeAgeAndName();

#### Answer: C

Both the `changeAge` and `changeAgeAndName` functions have a default parameter, namely a _newly_ created object `{ ...person }`. This object has copies of all the key/values in the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `changeAge` function and pass the `person` object as its argument. This function increases the value of the `age` property by 1. `person` is now `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

Then, we invoke the `changeAgeAndName` function, however we don't pass a parameter. Instead, the value of `x` is equal to a _new_ object: `{ ...person }`. Since it's a new object, it doesn't affect the values of the properties on the `person` object. `person` is still equal to `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.
