#### Answer: D

Variables declared with the `const` keyword are not referenceable before their initialization: this is called the _temporal dead zone_. In the `getInfo` function, the variable `randomValue` is scoped in the functional scope of `getInfo`. On the line where we want to log the value of `typeof randomValue`, the variable `randomValue` isn't initialized yet: a `ReferenceError` gets thrown! The engine didn't go down the scope chain since we declared the variable `randomValue` in the `getInfo` function.
