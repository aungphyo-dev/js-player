#### Answer: D

`counterOne` is an instance of the `Counter` class. The counter class contains a `count` property on its constructor, and an `increment` method. First, we invoked the `increment` method twice by calling `counterOne.increment()`. Currently, `counterOne.count` is `2`.

Then, we create a new variable `counterTwo`, and set it equal to `counterOne`. Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that `counterOne` points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that `counterTwo` has a reference to, also apply to `counterOne`. Currently, `counterTwo.count` is `2`.

We invoke `counterTwo.increment()`, which sets `count` to `3`. Then, we log the count on `counterOne`, which logs `3`.
