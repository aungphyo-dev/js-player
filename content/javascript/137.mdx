#### Answer: C

The `Object.freeze` method _freezes_ an object. No properties can be added, modified, or removed.

However, it only _shallowly_ freezes the object, meaning that only _direct_ properties on the object are frozen. If the property is another object, like `address` in this case, the properties on that object aren't frozen, and can be modified.
