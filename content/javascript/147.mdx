#### Answer: C

The `if` condition within the `forEach` loop checks whether the value of `num` is truthy or falsy. Since the first number in the `nums` array is `0`, a falsy value, the `if` statement's code block won't be executed. `count` only gets incremented for the other 3 numbers in the `nums` array, `1`, `2` and `3`. Since `count` gets incremented by `1` 3 times, the value of `count` is `3`.
