#### Answer: C

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called _implicit type coercion_. **Coercion** is converting from one type into another.

In this example, JavaScript converts the number `1` into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (`1`) and a string type (`'2'`), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like `"Hello" + "World"`, so what's happening here is `"1" + "2"` which returns `"12"`.
