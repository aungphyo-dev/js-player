#### Answer: A

The `updateEmail` function is an arrow function, and is not bound to the `user` object. This means that the `this` keyword is not referring to the `user` object, but refers to the global scope in this case. The value of `email` within the `user` object does not get updated. When logging the value of `user.email`, the original value of `my@email.com` gets returned.
