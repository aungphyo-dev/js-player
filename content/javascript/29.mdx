#### Answer: B

Object keys are automatically converted into strings. We are trying to set an object as a key to object `a`, with the value of `123`.

However, when we stringify an object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. So what we are saying here, is that `a["[object Object]"] = 123`. Then, we can try to do the same again. `c` is another object that we are implicitly stringifying. So then, `a["[object Object]"] = 456`.

Then, we log `a[b]`, which is actually `a["[object Object]"]`. We just set that to `456`, so it returns `456`.
