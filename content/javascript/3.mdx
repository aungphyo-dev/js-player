###### 3. What's the output?

```javascript
const shape = {
  radius: 10,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());
```

- A: `20` and `62.83185307179586`
- B: `20` and `NaN`
- C: `20` and `63`
- D: `NaN` and `63`

#### Answer: B

Note that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function.

With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).

There is no value `radius` on that object, which returns `NaN`.
