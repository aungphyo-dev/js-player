#### Answer: B

When a constructor function is called with the `new` keyword, it creates an object and sets the `this` keyword to refer to that object. By default, if the constructor function doesn't explicitly return anything, it will return the newly created object.

In this case, the constructor function `Car` explicitly returns a new object with `make` set to `"Maserati"`, which overrides the default behavior. Therefore, when `new Car()` is called, the _returned_ object is assigned to `myCar`, resulting in the output being `"Maserati"` when `myCar.make` is accessed.
