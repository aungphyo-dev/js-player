#### Answer: A

We can delete properties from objects using the `delete` keyword, also on the prototype. By deleting a property on the prototype, it is not available anymore in the prototype chain. In this case, the `bark` function is not available anymore on the prototype after `delete Dog.prototype.bark`, yet we still try to access it.

When we try to invoke something that is not a function, a `TypeError` is thrown. In this case `TypeError: pet.bark is not a function`, since `pet.bark` is `undefined`.
