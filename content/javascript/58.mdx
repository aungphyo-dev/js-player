#### Answer: A

The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`. However, variables declared with the `var`, `const` or `let` keyword cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.

The `name` variable was declared with a `const` keyword, so its deletion is not successful: `false` is returned. When we set `age` equal to `21`, we actually added a property called `age` to the global object. You can successfully delete properties from objects this way, also the global object, so `delete age` returns `true`.
