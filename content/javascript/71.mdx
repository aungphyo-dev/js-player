###### 71. How can we log the values that are commented out after the console.log statement?

```javascript
function* startGame() {
  const answer = yield 'Do you love JavaScript?';
  if (answer !== 'Yes') {
    return "Oh wow... Guess we're done here";
  }
  return 'JavaScript loves you back ❤️';
}

const game = startGame();
console.log(/* 1 */); // Do you love JavaScript?
console.log(/* 2 */); // JavaScript loves you back ❤️
```

- A: `game.next("Yes").value` and `game.next().value`
- B: `game.next.value("Yes")` and `game.next.value()`
- C: `game.next().value` and `game.next("Yes").value`
- D: `game.next.value()` and `game.next.value("Yes")`

#### Answer: C

A generator function "pauses" its execution when it sees the `yield` keyword. First, we have to let the function yield the string "Do you love JavaScript?", which can be done by calling `game.next().value`.

Every line is executed, until it finds the first `yield` keyword. There is a `yield` keyword on the first line within the function: the execution stops with the first yield! _This means that the variable `answer` is not defined yet!_

When we call `game.next("Yes").value`, the previous `yield` is replaced with the value of the parameters passed to the `next()` function, `"Yes"` in this case. The value of the variable `answer` is now equal to `"Yes"`. The condition of the if-statement returns `false`, and `JavaScript loves you back ❤️` gets logged.
