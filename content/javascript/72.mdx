#### Answer: C

`String.raw` returns a string where the escapes (`\n`, `\v`, `\t` etc.) are ignored! Backslashes can be an issue since you could end up with something like:

`` const path = `C:\Documents\Projects\table.html` ``

Which would result in:

`"C:DocumentsProjects able.html"`

With `String.raw`, it would simply ignore the escape and print:

`C:\Documents\Projects\table.html`

In this case, the string is `Hello\nworld`, which gets logged.
