#### Answer: B

`Object.freeze` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` would return true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.

Since `shape` is frozen, and since the value of `x` is not an object, we cannot modify the property `x`. `x` is still equal to `10`, and `{ x: 10, y: 20 }` gets logged.
