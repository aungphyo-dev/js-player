#### Answer: A

With a _for-in_ loop, we can iterate over **enumerable** properties. In an array, the enumerable properties are the "keys" of array elements, which are actually their indexes. You could see an array as:

`{0: "☕", 1: "💻", 2: "🍷", 3: "🍫"}`

Where the keys are the enumerable properties. `0` `1` `2` `3` get logged.

With a _for-of_ loop, we can iterate over **iterables**. An array is an iterable. When we iterate over the array, the variable "item" is equal to the element it's currently iterating over, `"☕"` `"💻"` `"🍷"` `"🍫"` get logged.
