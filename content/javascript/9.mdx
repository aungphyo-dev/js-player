#### Answer: A

It logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped `greeting` as `greetign`, the JS interpreter actually saw this as:

1. `global.greetign = {}` in Node.js
2. `window.greetign = {}`, `frames.greetign = {}` and `self.greetign` in browsers.
3. `self.greetign` in web workers.
4. `globalThis.greetign` in all environments.

In order to avoid this, we can use `"use strict"`. This makes sure that you have declared a variable before setting it equal to anything.
