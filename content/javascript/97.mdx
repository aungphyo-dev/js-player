###### 95. What's the output?

```javascript
function nums(a, b) {
  if (a > b) console.log('a is bigger');
  else console.log('b is bigger');
  return;
  a + b;
}

console.log(nums(4, 2));
console.log(nums(1, 2));
```

- A: `a is bigger`, `6` and `b is bigger`, `3`
- B: `a is bigger`, `undefined` and `b is bigger`, `undefined`
- C: `undefined` and `undefined`

#### Answer: B

In JavaScript, we don't _have_ to write the semicolon (`;`) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.

Here, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:

```javascript
return;
a + b;
```

This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!
